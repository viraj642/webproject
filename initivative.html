  <h4 style="color: black; font-family: arial; padding-right: auto; ">At our organization, we believe that we can surely make a difference by upbringing our child with a secure and promising future and it can only happen when we educate our child. Right to education is the fundamental right which is granted by the Constitution of India. Education enables a child to lay strong foothold in this world. It enables you to stand on your feet and earn a livelihood for yourself.
We rigorously attempt to educate every child we come across from the weaker sections of the society and give them an ability to stand on their own feet and contribute towards the economy of the nation. We have organised a number of camps and workshops in various areas to create awareness about the importance of education among the people. We also help the children in monetary terms. Further, we provide stationary to the needy children. Our main motive is to create awareness about education to the marginalised children.</h4>

<div>
  <h4 style="color: black; font-family: arial; padding-right: auto; ">Life is precious and cannot be put a price tag on. Noone will ever be able to evaluate what the life of one person is worth but in life, we are often faced with circumstances where there is a price attached to saving someone’s life.
Poverty is one of the worst evils known to India today and many are falling into its grip day by day to such an extent that even two square meals are too much to ask for. For people living under such circumstances, a life-threatening disease like cancer, brain tumor or a hole in the heart can mean the end of an era. For people who can barely afford food, filling hospital bills is unfathomable.
Even as we are as a country progressing towards being a developed country, according to recent statistics two million children die in India every year due to lack of funds while every day almost three thousand are encountered with the same.
At Dream Girl Foundation we try to bring relief to such families by providing financial assistance and taking the responsibility of the money involved in the treatment of children suffering from such diseases. Our project called “Project Zindagi” aims to provide life to many. We consider ourselves lucky that we are given an opportunity to offer a new life to someone and transform it for the best but we cannot do this alone. We need equal support from you.
For those of you are well off and have not been kicked hard by the fatal leg of poverty, we request you to come forward and assist us in this endeavor of ours so that no lives are lost due to lack of financial resources. We organise crowdfunding campaigns to help raise funds for the children so come ahead and be a part. Remember, the shortest corpses are always the heaviest.</h4>
